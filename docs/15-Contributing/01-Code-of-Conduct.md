# Code of Conduct

The original module that this module was forked from has a code of conduct - see [Code-of-Conduct.](https://codeberg.org/Firesphere/silverstripe-solr/src/branch/main/docs/14-Contributing/01-Code-of-Conduct.md)

At this time, Signify does not have a published code of conduct for modules so the contents of this file have been removed.
